<h2><hr><a name="biography"></a>Brief Biography</h2>
I am a machine learning researcher with research interests in reliable machine learning and weakly supervised learning. I am currently a professor at College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China and a visiting scientist at Imperfect Information Learning Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project, Japan.

I received my Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2021, supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/" target="_blank">Prof. Bo An</a>.
I was a research intern at Imperfect Information Learning Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project, supervised by <a href="http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/" target="_blank">Prof. Masashi Sugiyama</a> and <a href="https://niug1984.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Gang Niu</a>. Before my Ph.D. study, I received my B.E. degree from College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, China, in 2017.
